      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Raspberry Pi setup is constantly changing. They are my mini homelab. Used when I want containers to run on a more permanant basis.
All average at about 3W in power, making them very efficient to their tasks. Most have Docker installed and are blocked from access
to the internet if hosting private information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Proxmox Setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Proxmox is hosted on my Dell R710 server. With 24 threads, 32GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage. Whilst the R710
is a powerfull system, it is very power hungry. With a minimum power draw of 180w. As a result I have made
the decision to only run the server when I wish to mess around with virtual machines.
It&amp;rsquo;s main purpose is for developing more solid applications that can be deployed to more power efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
